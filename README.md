# Meditation App

A simple and elegant meditation timer to enhance your mindfulness practice.

After a few years of meditation, I realized that I really appreciated the church bells in my neighborhood which would ring every 15 minutes.
It allowed me to not have to set a timer, and not use a guided meditation, but still get regular reminders to focus my attention, and
it gave me the a sense of time passing by, allowing me to flexibly decide how long to meditate on a given day.

Do with it whatever you may, I'll add Vercel Hosting if this gets any attention :)
